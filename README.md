# Loan-Default-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a borrower will fully repay their loan. By analyzing historical loan data from LendingClub, the goal is to identify characteristics that indicate a higher probability of loan default or repayment, ultimately helping investors make informed decisions.
